# AFE Partner Connections
The purpose of AFE Partner Connections is to seamlessly integrate Operators AFE Systems to digitially exchange AFEs.  We integrate directly with the Operator's AFE system by importing internally approved AFEs.  We then notify the Partners there is a new AFE for approval via email ntifications.  Partners can download the AFE directly from AFE Partner Connections, translate the account library to their own and extract data in a format for uploading into their own AFE System.
Once approved or rejected by the partner the Operator is notified via email and can update thier own AFE System.
